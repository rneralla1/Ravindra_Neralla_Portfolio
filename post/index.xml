      <description>Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concern for every company. Retaining an existing customer is many times more effective than gaining new customers. Companies usually have a greater focus on customer acquisition and keep retention as a secondary priority. However, it can cost five times more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. Increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%, according to research done by Bain &amp;amp; Company.</description>

      <description>Most of the people around the world are restricted to home due to COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in more online activities like buying regular groceries also shifted to online.

Surprisingly, this amount is superior to profits posted by some of the blue chip companies in 2017, such as as Coca-Cola ($2 billions), Warren Buffetâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway ($24 billions) and JP Morgan Chase ($23.</description>

      <description>In financial industry, deciding on a loan application, whether to approve or not is a two-edged sword. Bank should not lose business by denying a legitimate customer, who can repay. Also, it should not approve loan to in-eligible customer. Banks are playing important role in challenging times like now, with COVID pandemic across the globe.

      <description>This project involves analyzing Chicago crime data for the year 2019 with respect to weather and holidays. One of the major difficulties I found while in this project is on getting holidays data into python from website. I could not get the required the data using web scraping, put some extra effort to learn on how to identify the required data and capture into data frame. Chicago weather data is sourced using weather API.</description>

      <description>Presenting data to audience is quite different from designing visuals, while presenting data I felt like we should start with an interest fact on the topic we are going to present, so I started with evolution in transportation to set the audience to common ground. Later started with recent auto vs plane crashes by talking about recent Texas road accident and Malaysian and Indonesian airline accidents. Next step is talking about the charts and visuals prepared to explain the core objective by numbers</description>
